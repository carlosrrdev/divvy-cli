## What is Divvy?

In so few words, Divvy is simply an expense splitting tool that excells at taking expenses, summing them up, and splitting them between individuals or groups, key emphasis on **groups**. So yes, while Divvy *can* be used to quickly split expenses evenly between individuals, its real power shines in its ability to split expenses seperately based on groups where not all members of a group participate in all expenses.

## Goal

As mentioned previously, Divvy is intended to be used to *divvy up* expenses between groups. I created this project to solve my own real-life problem of sharing expenses between roomates - some expenses were shared evenly while others were paid for by one or more roomates - in my particular case, I was the one actually paying the expenses and my roomates would reinburse me later, so having a way to track exactly who was paying for what was important.
